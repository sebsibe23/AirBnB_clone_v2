DESCRIPTION:
    This script defines the FileStorage class for AirBnB, which
    serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON
    files to instances.

MODULES:
    - json: Provides methods for working with JSON data.
    - models.base_model: Importing the BaseModel class.
    - models.user: Importing the User class.
    - models.state: Importing the State class.
    - models.city: Importing the City class.
    - models.amenity: Importing the Amenity class.
    - models.place: Importing the Place class.
    - models.review: Importing the Review class.
    - shlex: Provides a lexical analyzer for simple syntaxes.

CLASSES:
    - FileStorage: A class that handles serialization and
      deserialization of instances to/from a JSON file.

ATTRIBUTES:
    - __file_path: The path to the JSON file.
    - __objects: A dictionary that stores the serialized objects.

METHODS:
    - all(self, cls=None): Returns a dictionary of objects.
    - new(self, obj): Sets the __objects dictionary.
    - save(self): Serializes the objects to the JSON file.
    - reload(self): Deserializes the JSON file to objects.
    - delete(self, obj=None): Deletes an object from __objects.
    - close(self): Calls the reload() method.
